Scrypt for Python
==

There are a lot of different scrypt modules for Python, but none of them have
everything that I'd like, so here's One More[1].

Features
--
* Uses system libscrypt[2] â€“ as up to date as your distro is.
* Offers a pure Python scrypt implementation for when there's no libscrypt.
* Not unusably slow, even in pure Python... at least with pypy[3]. (More than
  one tenth the C speed, anyway.)

Requirements
--
* Python 2.7 or 3.4 or so. Pypy 2.2 also works. Older versions may or may not.
* If you want speed: libscrypt 1.8 (older may work).

TODO
--
* Automate the choice of which implementation to use.
* Embed C implementation for when there's no system library?
* Numpy implementation sounds interesting.
